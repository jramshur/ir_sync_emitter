# Description

The IR Sync Emitter is a device that produces a high intensity IR pulse when a TTL type signal is received on its input. The duration of the pulse is determined by the duration of the TTL input.

It was designed to be used as a means of wirelessly synchronizing rack mounted electrophysiology equipment with the [SRD brain computer interface](http://github.com/jramshur/srd_gui). However, it is not limited to this use.

**Warning:** Use caution when operating this device. Intense IR light can cause retinal damage.
